        <!-- Recipe description -->
        <p>These crispy baked chicken wings are a perfect combination of savory seasoning and spicy buffalo sauce. 
            The wings are coated with a simple yet flavorful blend of garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper, then baked to golden perfection. 
            The result is crispy skin and juicy meat on the inside. 
            After baking, the wings are tossed in a buttery buffalo sauce, giving them the classic spicy, tangy flavor that's a favorite at any gathering or game day.</p>
        <p>This recipe is not only easy to make but also customizable depending on your spice tolerance or sauce preference. 
            Whether you like your wings extra hot or prefer a milder version, you can adjust the sauce accordingly. 
            Serve them alongside fresh celery and carrot sticks, along with your favorite dipping sauce, for the ultimate chicken wing experience.</p>

        <h2>Recipe steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400 F (200 C).</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the wings:</strong> Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This will help them get crispy when baked.</li>
            <li><strong>Season the wings:</strong>  In a large bowl, toss the wings with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional), and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional). Make sure the wings are evenly coated.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrange on baking sheet:</strong> Place the wings in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the wings:</strong> Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the wings are golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the sauce:</strong> While the wings are baking, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Once melted, stir in 1/2 cup of buffalo sauce or hot sauce, mixing well.</li>
            <li><strong>Toss the wings in sauce:</strong> When the wings are done baking, remove them from the oven and place them in a large bowl. Pour the buffalo sauce mixture over the wings and toss to coat evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve immediately with optional sides like celery sticks, carrot sticks, and blue cheese or ranch dressing for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
